# BasementOS

BasementOS is a haunted, lore-driven Linux distro experiment built inside the Hauntworks lab.  
It blends creative theming, ghost-coded processes, and customized Linux tooling to create a feral, immersive OS experience.

This repository will serve as the home for:

- system concepts  
- distro structure  
- themes, dotfiles, and visuals  
- early scripts and daemon ideas  
- patch notes and dev logs  
- future installer development  

BasementOS is currently in its early concept phase.
More updates coming soon.
